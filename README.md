# NSGA-II
This is an implementation of NSGA-II (A fast and elitist multi-objective genetic algorithm: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/996017)

With the help of https://github.com/haris989/NSGA-II/tree/master

Above link was for SCH problem but I implemented this algorithm for four other complex problems (ZDT2 , ZDT3 , ZDT4, ZDT6)

hope you enjoy;))
